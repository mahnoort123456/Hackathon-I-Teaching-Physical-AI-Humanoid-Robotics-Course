Chapter 3: Technical Skills Development

Programming for Robotics Systems

Proficiency in robotics programming requires mastering multiple languages and frameworks. Python serves as the primary language for algorithm development and machine learning integration, while C++ offers performance for real-time control systems. Introduce students to ROS (Robot Operating System) as the industry-standard middleware for robot software architecture. Teach modular programming practices where perception, planning, and control components communicate through well-defined interfaces, enabling code reuse and collaborative development.

Machine Learning Applications in Physical AI

Modern humanoid robots rely heavily on machine learning for perception and control. Cover supervised learning for object recognition and pose estimation, reinforcement learning for discovering locomotion policies, and imitation learning for acquiring skills from human demonstrations. Students should implement neural networks for visual processing, understand policy gradient methods for continuous control, and explore transfer learning techniques that adapt behaviors across different robot morphologies.

Sensor Integration and Perception Systems

Perception enables robots to understand their environment and make informed decisions. Teach students to work with diverse sensors including cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and force-torque sensors. Cover computer vision fundamentals like image preprocessing, feature extraction, and object detection using modern deep learning architectures. Address sensor fusion techniques that combine multiple modalities to build robust world models despite individual sensor limitations or failures.

Control Theory and Motion Planning

Stable, efficient movement distinguishes successful humanoid robots from experimental prototypes. Introduce classical control theory including PID controllers and state-space methods, then progress to advanced techniques like model predictive control and optimal control. Cover motion planning algorithms from basic trajectory generation to complex whole-body planning that coordinates dozens of degrees of freedom while maintaining balance and avoiding obstacles.
